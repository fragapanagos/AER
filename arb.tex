\section{$N$-way Arbiter ($N\!\_ARB$)}

The $N$-way arbiter $N\_ARB$ arbitrates between $N$ children (see Figure~\ref{fig:n_arb}) and is specified by

\begin{figure}

  \caption{$N\!\_ARB$ arbitrates between $N$ children.}
  \label{fig:n_arb}
\end{figure}

\begin{csp}
N_ARB(N)\equiv
  *[[\langle\|n:0..N\-1:#{C`n}->C`n;C`n\rangle]]
\end{csp}

\begin{figure}

  \caption{$N\!\_ARB$ decomposed as a binary tree of $N\!\_ARB\_$ cells. Here is an $N\!\_ARB$ instance servicing 4 children. The $P$ port of the top $N\!\_ARB\_$ cell is connected back to itself.}
  \label{fig:n_arb_n_arb_}
\end{figure}

In words, the children send requests at any time. When requests arrive, $N\!\_ARB$ selects one requesting child to proceed. The first $C_n$ communication indicates that the child should proceed, and the second $C_n$ communication confirms that the child has finished.

We construct the $N\!\_ARB$ as a binary tree of $N\!\_ARB\_$ cells recursively (see Figure~\ref{fig:n_arb_n_arb_}). 

\begin{csp}
N_ARB_(N)\equiv
  [ N=1 ->
    \mathrm{wire}
  [] N=2 ->
    H_ARB
  [] N>2 ->
    N_ARB_(N/2)\pll\!H_ARB\pll\!N_ARB_(N\-N/2)
  ]
\end{csp}

\noindent The recursion ends with $N=1$ or $N=2$ and produces a balanced tree. The top $N\_ARB\_$'s $P$ port is connected back to itself. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Heirarchical arbiter $H\_ARB$}

$H\!\_ARB$ coordinates with its parent (another $H\!\_ARB$ instance) and arbitrates between two children. 
With ports

\begin{tabular}[]{rl}
$C0$ & child 0 port \\
$C1$ & child 1 port \\
$P$ & parent port \\
\end{tabular} \\

\noindent $H\!\_ARB$ is specified by

\begin{csp}
H_ARB\equiv
  *[[#{C`0}|#{C`1}->P;
    [#{C`0}->C`0;C`0\|~#{C`0}->skip];
    [#{C`1}->C`1;C`1\|~#{C`1}->skip];P]]
\end{csp}

When a child request arrives, $H\!\_ARB$ sends a request to its parent. When the parent gives permission to go ahead, $H\!\_ARB$ checks the first child and then the second child. During each check, $H\!\_ARB$ services the child if its request is present. Otherwise, $H\!\_ARB$ skips and moves on. After checking the children, $H\!\_ARB$ releases its parent.

$H\!\_ARB$ implements a greedy yet fair arbitration algorithm. $H\!\_ARB$ is greedy because it can service both children for a single request to the parent. $H\!\_ARB$ is fair because it will service each child at most once for each request to the parent. 

\begin{figure}

  \caption{$H\_ARB$ decomposition. Dotted line indicates wire used for probing only.}
  \label{fig:h_arb_detail}
\end{figure}

We decompose $H\!\_ARB$ into a control cell $CTRL$ and two child arbitration cells $C\_ARB$ as in Figure~\ref{fig:h_arb_detail}.

\begin{csp}
H\_ARB\equiv\!CTRL\pll\!C_ARB\pll\!C_ARB
\end{csp}

  \caption{$H\!\_ARB$ after bubble reshuffling. Ports are expanded and inverters introduced by bubble reshuffling are shown.}
  \label{fig:h_arb_bubbled}
\end{figure}

\noindent Bubble reshuffling $CTRL$ and $C\_ARB$ yields the $H\!\_ARB$ shown in Figure~\ref{fig:h_arb_bubbled}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Control cell $CTRL$}
$CTRL$ sequences communications with the parent of $H\!\_ARB$ and the child arbiters.
$CTRL$ has ports

\begin{tabular}[]{rl}
$P$ & parent port \\
$S_0$ & child arbiter 0 port \\
$S_1$ & child arbiter 1 port \\
\end{tabular} \\

\paragraph{CHP}\mbox{}\\

\begin{csp}
CTRL\equiv
  *[[#{C`0}|#{C`1}->P;S`0;S`0;S`1;S`1;P]]
\end{csp}

\noindent where 

\begin{tabular}[]{rl}
  $C_0$ & probes child 0 \\
  $C_1$ & probes child 1 \\
  $P$ & communicates with the parent \\
  $S_0$ & communicates with the child 0 arbiter \\
  $S_1$ & communicates with the child 1 arbiter \\
\end{tabular} \\ \\

\paragraph{HSE}\mbox{}\\

\noindent Directly translating the CHP,

\begin{hse}
CTRL\equiv
  *[[c0i|c1i];po+;[pi];
    s0o+;[s0i];[~s0i];s0o-;
    s1o+;[s1i];[~s1i];s1o-;
    po-;[~pi]]
\end{hse}

\noindent There are 3 indistinguishable states--after $[p_i]$, after $s0_o\!\downarrow$, and after $s1_o\!\downarrow$. The correct operation of $CTRL$ precludes reshuffling to break symmetry, so we use 2 state variables to distinguish betwen the 3 states.

\begin{hse}
CTRL\equiv
  *[[c0i|c1i];po+;[pi];x-;
    s0o+;[s0i];y-;s0o-;[~s0i];
    s1o+;[s1i];x+;s1o-;[~s1i];
    po-;[~pi];y+]
\end{hse}

\paragraph{PRS}\mbox{}\\

\begin{prs2}
(c0i | c1i) & y -> po+
~s1i & x & ~y -> po-
\end{prs2}

\begin{prs2}
s1i & ~y -> x+
pi & y -> x-

~pi -> y+
s0i -> y-
\end{prs2}

\begin{prs2}
~x & y -> s0o+
x | ~y -> s0o-

~s0i & ~x & ~y -> s1o+
x -> s1o-
\end{prs2}

\noindent after bubble reshuffling

\begin{prs2}
(~_c0i | ~_c1i) & ~_y -> po+
_s1i & x & _y -> po-

po -> _po-
~po -> _po+
\end{prs2}

\begin{prs2}
~x & ~_y -> s0o+
x | _y -> s0o-

~s0i & ~x & ~y -> s1o+
x -> s1o-
\end{prs2}

\begin{prs2}
~_s1i & ~y -> x+
pi & y -> x-

~pi -> y+
s0i -> y-
\end{prs2}

Including staticizers, $CTRL$ contains 36 transistors.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Child Arbiter ($C\!\_ARB$)}
$C\!\_ARB$ determines whether or not a child's request is present when called upon by $CTRL$.

\paragraph{CHP}\mbox{}\\

\begin{csp}
C_ARB\equiv
  *[[#C->S;C;C;S
    \|#S->S;S]]
\end{csp}

\noindent where 

\begin{tabular}[]{rl}
  $C$ & communicates with the child \\ 
  $S$ & communicates with $CTRL$ \\
\end{tabular} \\ \\

We arbitrate between requests from the child, $\overline{C}$, and 
requests from $CTRL$, $\overline{S}$. If a child request is present, the arbiter is biased towards selecting the child because $S$ requests will not arrive until $CTRL$ has obtained permission from the parent. Although small, there is a chance that a child's request will be skipped on a given iteration of $CTRL$, but the weakly fair assumption ensures that the child will be serviced eventually.

\noindent If the arbitration selects the child request $\overline{C}$, $C\!\_ARB$

\begin{tabular}[]{rl}
  $S$ & waits for and acknowledge $CTRL$'s request \\
  $C$ & signals the child to proceed \\
  $C$ & waits for the child to complete \\
  $S$ & releases $CTRL$ so it can move on \\
\end{tabular} \\ \\

\noindent If the arbitration selects $CTRL$'s request $\overline{S}$, $C\!\_ARB$

\begin{tabular}[]{rl}
  $S$ & waits for and acknowledge $CTRL$'s request \\
  $S$ & releases $CTRL$ so it can move on \\
\end{tabular} \\ \\

\noindent which is a simple 4-phase handshake. Note that $S$ is shared between the two branches.

\paragraph{HSE}\mbox{}\\

\noindent Directly translating the CHP,

\begin{hse}
*[[ci->[si];so+;co+;[~ci];co-;[~si];so-
  \|si->so+;[~si];so-]]
\end{hse}

\noindent We introduce intermediate variables $c$ and $s$ to represent the arbitration,

\begin{hse}
*[[ci->c+;[si];so+;co+;[~ci];c-;co-;[~si];so-
  \|si->s+;so+;[~si];s-;so-]]
\end{hse}

\noindent and break out the arbitration into a separate process

\begin{hse}
*[[ci->c+;[~ci];c-
  \|si->s+;[~si];s-]]
*[[c->[si];so+;co+;[~c];co-;[~si];so-
  []s->so+;[~s];so-]]
\end{hse}

\noindent Note that the $c$ branch of the select statement uses $s_i$ and not $s$. In addition, as soon as $c_o$ goes high, $c_i$ could clear before $s_i$, which would allow the arbitration process to complete its $c_i$ branch and select the $s_i$ branch while the $c$ branch is still in progress. We thus wait for $s_i$ to clear before communicating with the child.

\begin{hse}
*[[ci->c+;[~ci];c-
  \|si->s+;[~si];s-]]
*[[c->[si];so+;[~si];co+;[~c];co-;so-
  []s->so+;[~s];so-]]
\end{hse}

\noindent After $co\!\downarrow$, the child could raise its request again ($c_i$) and greedily hold the circuit in a loop servicing the child. We break this loop by releasing $CTRL$ ($s_o\!\downarrow$) before releasing the child.

\begin{hse}
*[[ci->c+;[~ci];c-
  \|si->s+;[~si];s-]]
*[[c->[si];so+;[~si];co+;[~c];so-;co-
  []s->so+;[~s];so-]]
\end{hse}

\noindent Note that $s_o$ is shared between both branches of selection statement. This sharing results in interfering production rules for $s_o$, so we introduce intermediate values $cs_o$ and $ss_o$ and merge them in a third concurrent process.

\begin{hse}
*[[ci->c+;[~ci];c-
  \|si->s+;[~si];s-]]\pll
*[[c->[si];cso+;[~si];co+;[~c];cso-;co-
  []s->sso+;[~s];sso-]]\pll
*[[cso->so+;[~cso];so-]
  []sso->so+;[~sso];so-]
\end{hse}

\paragraph{PRS}\mbox{}\\

\noindent $s_i$ and $c_i$ are inputs to a standard 2-input arbiter, which outputs $s$ and $c$.

\begin{prs2}
c & si & ~sso -> cso+
~c -> cso-

s & ~co -> sso+
~s | co -> sso-
\end{prs2}

\begin{prs2}
~si & cso -> co+
si | ~cso -> co-

cso | sso -> so+
~cso & ~sso -> so-
\end{prs2}

\noindent after bubble reshuffling

\begin{prs2}
~_c & ~_si & ~sso -> cso+
_c -> cso-

~_s & ~co -> sso+
_s | co -> sso-
\end{prs2}

\begin{prs2}
_si & cso -> _co-
~_si | ~cso -> _co+

_co -> co-
~_co -> co+

cso | sso -> _so-
~cso & ~sso -> _so+
\end{prs2}

\noindent where $\_s$ and $\_c$ come from an active-low 2-input arbiter with inputs $\_s_i$ and $\_c_i$. 

\noindent Including staticizers, $C\_ARB$ requires 34 transistors.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{$H\_ARB$ Accounting}

$H\_ARB$ includes 2 $C\_ARB$ circuits and 1 $CTRL$ circuit with 3 additional inverters. Therefore, $H\_ARB$ requires 114 transistors.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{$N\_ARB$ Accounting}

$N\_ARB$ will be constructed from $N-1$ $H\_ARB$ instances. We will also require $N$ inverters to connect with the client's input and 1 inverter to connect the top of the tree back to itself. Therefore, $N\_ARB$ requires $110(N-1)+2N+2=112(N-1)+4$ transistors.

\begin{table}

  \begin{tabular}{|r|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}

    $N$ & 2 & 3 & 4 & 8 & 16 & 32 & 64 & 128 & 256 \\

    transistors & 116 & 228 & 340 & 788 & 1684 & 3476 & 7060 & 14228 & 28564 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{tab:n_arb_cost}Transistor count for common sizes of $N\_ARB$. Note that the basic, 2-input arbiter only requires 12 transistors, tenfold less than a 2-input $N\_ARB$.}
