Contains basic spice simulations

emx1of4 demostrates how to use eMx1of4 channels.
Note that for now (29/1/16) we cannot use generalized eMx1ofN sources and sinks.

a1of2 demonstrates how to use a1of2 channels.

celement demostrates a basic C-element.

ccoupling checks for capacative coupling among the data wires.
See ccoupling/cx_capture.png
I had seen weird coupling in other simulations and wanted to test a more basic case.
I don't see any unexpected capacative coupling between nodes.
